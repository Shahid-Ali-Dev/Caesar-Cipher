# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Text Encryptor & Decryptor (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that implements a simple **Caesar cipher**—a classic encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🧠 What It Does

- ✅ Takes user input for a **message** and a **shift number**
- ✅ Lets you choose between **encryption** (`encode`) and **decryption** (`decode`)
- ✅ Shifts alphabet letters by a user-defined amount
- ✅ Handles wrapping from `'z'` to `'a'` correctly using modular arithmetic
- ✅ Maintains spaces and symbols without altering them
- ✅ Offers a **loop option** to repeat multiple encryptions or decryptions

## 📦 How to Use

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
